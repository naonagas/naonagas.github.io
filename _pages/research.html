<li> Identifying Macro Shocks from Micro Evidence: A Mixed-Autoregressive Approach (Draft coming soon) </li>
    <ol style="list-style: none">
        <li> This paper develops an approach to identify aggregate shocks by exploiting heterogeneous direct (partial equilibrium) effects estimated from microeconometric research designs. The total effect of a shock consists of direct and indirect (general equilibrium) effects, but microeconometric tools typically do not capture the latter. Our framework builds on a time-series econometric model that incorporates both aggregate variables and functional observations, such as cross-sectional densities. We show how direct effects can be used as identification restrictions to recover the total effect. We apply the framework to compare the effects of lump-sum and targeted stimulus transfer policies on aggregate outcomes and consumption inequality. </li>

        <li> This paper proposes regime-switching state space models with feedback from lagged
continuous state variables to regime formation. Regime transition probabilities
implied from such a regime rule can be incorporated into the Kalman filter with
regime-switching coefficients. It is shown that the truncation step introduced in the
filter to circumvent the path dependence problem has an asymptotically negligible
impact on the resulting log likelihood. Consistency of the maximized likelihood
estimator can be established as well. Two simulation exercises confirm the finite
sample performance of the filter. I then study the monetary-fiscal policy mix using
the regime-switching DSGE model with the proposed regime determination rule to
archive a better forecasting performance especially around the time when a regime
change is likely. </li>

    <ol style="list-style: none">
        <li> Microeconometric approaches to answer macroeconomic questions regularly use time fixed effects. This leads to the well-known ‘missing intercept’ problem because fixed effects soak up average aggregate effects. As such, these results cannot be used to directly address policy questions requiring knowledge of policies’ aggregate effects. We present a statistical approach that leverages knowledge of these microeconometric results to jointly identify aggregate and idiosyncratic effects of changes in policy. We then apply our methodology to study government spending multipliers (Nakamura and Steinsson, 2014). </li>
