- Feedback in Regime Formation (Draft Available upon Request) <br> <br>
This paper proposes regime-switching state space models with feedback from lagged continuous state variables to regime formation. Regime transition probabilities implied from such a regime rule can be incorporated into the Kalman filter with regime-switching coefficients. It is shown that the truncation step introduced in the filter to circumvent the path dependence problem has an asymptotically negligible impact on the resulting log likelihood. Consistency of the maximized likelihood estimator can be established as well. Two simulation exercises confirm the finite sample performance of the filter. I then study the monetary-fiscal policy mix using the regime-switching DSGE model with the proposed regime determination rule to find feedback channels from government debt to the policy regime.
