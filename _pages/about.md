Welcome to my webpage! I am a Ph.D. student in Economics at Indiana University.

I am interested in macroeconomics and econometrics, with a particular focus on methodological and empirical investigations of nonlinearity and cross-sectional heterogeneity in the macroeconomy.

I will be on the 2025-2026 academic job market.
